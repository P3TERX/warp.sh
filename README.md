### Configuring Custom DNS

To configure custom DNS, set the environment variables `WireGuard_Interface_DNS_IPv4` and `WireGuard_Interface_DNS_IPv6`.

```bash
export WireGuard_Interface_DNS_IPv4 = '1.1.1.1,8.8.8.8'
export WireGuard_Interface_DNS_IPv6 = '2606:4700:4700::1111,2001:4860:4860::8888'
bash <(curl -fsSL git.io/warp.sh) proxy
```

### Example

- Install and automatically configure the Proxy Mode feature of the WARP client, enable the local loopback port 40000, and use an application that supports SOCKS5 to connect to this port.
    ```
    bash <(curl -fsSL git.io/warp.sh) proxy
    ```

- Install and automatically configure WARP IPv6 Network (with WireGuard)，Giving your Linux server access to IPv6 networks.
    ```
    bash <(curl -fsSL git.io/warp.sh) wg6
    ```

- This Bash script is also a good WireGuard installer.
    ```
    bash <(curl -fsSL git.io/warp.sh) wg
    ```
